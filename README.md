This is a repository containing all of the exercises from the first year Machine Learning and Real-World Data course. 
This introductory course focused on three main projects:
-	Na√Øve Bayes for classifying the sentiment of a movie review
-	Hidden Markov Models for analysing proteins to predict what parts of a protein are in a cell membrane
-	Graph analysis to find nodes of interest and shortest paths in a social network
